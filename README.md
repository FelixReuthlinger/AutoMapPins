# AutoMapPin

This mod serves as a kind of "radar" for your Valheim map, automatically creating temporary and persistent pins for
various in-game objects.

## Features

* [Server Synced](https://github.com/blaxxun-boop/ServerSync)
* Will create pins on Map and Minimap
    * **WARNING**: do better not configure too many to be active, it will flood your map!
* Pins created are using custom icons, see [Available icons](#available-icons)
* Pins can be configured, see [Pin configuration](#pin-configuration)
* Pins can be temporary (just visible when in area) or permanent (once discovered added permanently to map)
* Pin are loaded/created for game objects of Valheim types:
    * Destructible
    * Leviathan
    * Location
    * MineRock (ore)
    * MineRock5 (ore)
    * Pickable
    * TeleportWorld (portals)
    * PickableItem
    * Container (chests)
* Unknown (missing config) pins will be added to a temporary list that can be printed to a file to simplify
  configuration.
* Config file watchers (updated config file will be releaded)

# Configuration

* The mod generates a short BepInEx config file `FixItFelix.AutoMapPins.cfg`
* Most configuration is provided via YAML files, see [data model](#config-data-model)

## Pin configuration

* A default configuration for vanilla objects is shipped with the mod. The setting of active categories and pins is from
  my own experience of how I prefer to play (not flood my map). But you can edit and change those as you prefer.
* If you play with objects beyond the vanilla ones, you might need to create your own configuration file, the following
  sections will explain how to.

### Config data model

* all category and pin configuration is provided using YAML files

##### Yaml example

```yaml
ores: # category name for all the ore nodes
  categoryActive: true # category is active, pins will be loaded and displayed
  pins:
    rockcopper: # internal parsed name 
      categoryName: ores # needs to be same as on top
      internalName: rockcopper # needs to be same as internal parsed name
      name: Copper # show this pin with text "Copper" on map
      iconName: mine # use "mine" icon
      isPermanent: true # this will be displayed even if player leaves the area
      isActive: true # this pin will be shown
    minerocktin:
      categoryName: ores
      internalName: minerocktin
      name: Tin
      iconName: mine
      isPermanent: false # if tin would be shown, only when player in area
      isActive: false # tin will not be shown
      groupable: true # there are many tin piles sometimes, grouping active
      groupingDistance: 15 # default to group for 15 meters
```

##### Yaml internal name parsing

Rules:

* removes `(Clone)`
* removes `_`, `(`, `)`, `-`
* removed any numbers
* turns everything to lower case characters

Example: in-game loaded `gameObject.name` entry like `Mistlands_DvergrTownEntrance1`
or `Mistlands_DvergrTownEntrance1(Clone)`
will be parsed to: `mistlandsdvergrtownentrance`

### Create config file

* You can create multiple additional config files, the mod will load every file matching the pattern inside any sub
  folder of the `.../BepInEx/config/` path.
* Pattern for new files: `FixItFelix.AutoMapPins.categories.*.yaml` (replace "*" with your choice of name)
* There is a mechanic provided by the mod that will record any kind of pin that has a missing config while running
  through the world.
    * You can output all found config files using the console command `amp print_pins_missing_configs`
    * All configs created by that will have defaults set `n_a` and booleans set to `false`, change those according to
      the data model (see [data model](#config-data-model))
